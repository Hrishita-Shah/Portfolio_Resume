## Frontend React App (App Port: 5000)

- The React app is running on port 3000.
- It renders the user interface (UI) and handles user interactions.
- The React app makes HTTP requests to the backend server to fetch data and perform actions.

## Backend Server (Server Port: 5000)

- The backend server is running on port 5000 as specified in `.env` file.
- It handles the application's logic, data processing and communicates with the database or other external services.
- The backend provides APIs (endpoints) that the frontend can call to retrieve or manipulate data.
