# Email Setup Guide for Contact Form

## ðŸ”§ **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Create Environment File**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. **Gmail App Password Setup**

   - Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
   - Name it "Portfolio Contact Form"
   - Copy the generated 16-character password
3. **Use the App Password** in your `.env` file

### 3. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. **Start the Server**
```bash
npm run server
```

### 5. **Start the Client** (in a new terminal)
```bash
npm run client
```
